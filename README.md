# GSoC_19_Perceval_Implementations

### Introduction and Usage
CHAOSS has several working groups working on different focus areas to allow for an easier understanding of open source projects and communities. These metrics require good reference implementations to aid in understanding of their definitions and also to gauge their effectiveness. 

This repository tracks the progress of the project Implementing CHAOSS metrics with Perceval for GSoC 2019. It will house interactions with the mentors for this project, links to related blog posts, files and folders worked on as well related issues and pull requests.
