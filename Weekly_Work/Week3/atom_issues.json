First time contributing to any kind of language grammar.\n\nNote: Matching for `(->)` is done purposefully before matching for\n`(\\\\-|\\\\+|\\\\*|\\\\/|%)` (_keyword.operator.arithmetic.java_). The aforementioned regexp could be amended to `(\\\\-(?!>)|\\\\+|\\\\*|\\\\/|%)` so lambda expressions are never matched to minus symbols.

{"backend_name":"GitHub","backend_version":"0.17.4","category":"issue","data":{"assignee":null,"assignee_data":{},"assignees":[],"assignees_data":[],"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Main problem is the identification of variables.\nIt was too lenient in the first take because it didn't require the a space to exist (e.g. between `int` and `name` in `int name;`).\n\nI am not super happy with the current solution (repeating the \"generics, dots, commas blalba\" regex and check for a space in between), but I'm at a loss for better alternatives. The way it was before didn't work with generics (see comment in #47). At least this works in all cases.\n\nThe issue in #47 is different with this PR. E.g. example (row 13) below gets\n- `meta.definition.variable.java storage.type.java` on `Rectangle2D` (correct) \n- `meta.definition.variable.java punctuation.separator.period.java` on `.` (correct)\n- `meta.definition.variable.java variable.other.property.java` on `Double` (while correct, I'd like to se `storage.type.java` here too)\n- `meta.definition.variable.java variable.other.definition.java` on `d` (correct)\n\nSo much better, just a minor wrinkle to iron out.\n\nExample:\n![screen shot 2016-06-13 at 2 23 17 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/933880/16007388/66230ab8-3172-11e6-9851-634d1aeac77e.png)\n","closed_at":"2016-06-13T22:41:25Z","comments":4,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Tested this out and couldn't find anything wrong!

That's what the [language-html package has done](https://github.com/atom/language-html/blob/master/snippets/language-html.cson#L384).

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\nThis PR fixes issue with declaring static initializer as opposed to instance/method initializer. Currently if you write this in Java class:\r\n```java\r\nclass Test {\r\n  static HashSet<Integer> set = ...\r\n  static {\r\n    set.add(1);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nThe inside of initializer is not highlighted correctly (see image below), and treated as partially written method syntax.\r\n\r\nNote that instance/method initializers work correctly, pattern just does not understand `static` modifier prefix. I fixed by adding new pattern `static-initializer` that is built from `anonymous-block-and-instance-initializer` and `static` keyword, and added it into `class-body` scope. Also added tests for static/instance/method initializers.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"480\" alt=\"before\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/21488879/971ebd84-cc49-11e6-90fb-7789ddcf12ba.png\">\r\n<img width=\"493\" alt=\"after\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/21488883/9dbcc1ae-cc49-11e6-9c49-e07801d21e6e.png\">\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\nI considered first to add `static-initializer` totally separately with its own syntax, but that introduces more code changes and duplicates the effort of having two code blocks that handle the same functionality, really. I was also thinking about just modifying `anonymous-block-and-instance-initializer` itself to handle `static` in front of it, but thought that capturing optional group was not the best approach (could not see examples in existing code either).\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nFixes highlighting of static initializers.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\nPossibly breaks other parts of code, though it passes unit-tests.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\nCurrently there is a bug/feature of highlighting `static` inside method body. \r\n```java\r\nclass Test {\r\n  public void func() {\r\n    static {\r\n      int a = 1;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis happens in master branch, compiler complains about this code. I am not sure if this is expected, and/or I need to fix it in this PR.\r\n","closed_at":"2016-12-31T00:34:06Z","comments":4,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@50Wliu @noseglid Could you please review this PR?

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\nIn released version of Atom 1.13.0 and in current master branch there is an issue when expression inside `if (...)` is parsed as generics when capitalized variable is used with `<` and some other combinations, see screen shots below. This can even affect all subsequent highlighting as shown on image below (with string). For most part it is merely minor, out of ordinary highlighting of variables, not critical at all.\r\n\r\n![java-generic-overlap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/22488847/2c89f244-e879-11e6-9b5b-341156067eeb.png)\r\n![java-generic-overlap-3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/22488858/40302dd6-e879-11e6-82f1-639205447315.png)\r\n\r\n- Examples that break hightlighting: `if (A < a) { ... }`, `if (A < a && b < a) { ... }`, and `if (A < a || b > a) { ... }`\r\n- Examples that work: `if (a < A) { ... }`, `if (a < b) { ... }`\r\n\r\nI tried fixing most of the cases, currently I make sure that generic ends up on the same line. From what I have seen people keep generics expression on single line, and thought it would be a fair assumption to make. Code **does not fix** situations with logical operators, e.g. `&&`, `||`.  I also added tests for generics, which I think could be useful even if PR is closed (I can add tests separately).\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![java-generic-overlap-after-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/22489094/6f8a7b8a-e87a-11e6-86de-d4b6b36a436e.png)\r\n![java-generic-overlap-after-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/22489099/71b706f8-e87a-11e6-82ab-19f355aaa641.png)\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\nAs an alternative approach I was considering capturing `condition-block` similar to other patterns like `try-catch`, so we know that everything inside that block can be variable names and/or operators only. This would fix all cases above. I did not make the change for a reason of not being such critical at the moment and also wanted to hear from community, and discuss/approve approaches.  \r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nCurrent solution is simple, alternative would require more code, but it would cover all cases and potentially more robust to further changes (+ easy to maintain over long regex).\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\nMy change might affect some other untested cases.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Enter any applicable Issues here -->\r\n","closed_at":"2017-02-03T19:01:40Z","comments":7,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@50Wliu @noseglid could you review please?

For example, `{}` would cause the next line to be indented.  Also, `public:` would be dedented, and the next line would be indented.

This is unsatisfactory because single-line if statements should only have the following line indented.  As Atom currently does not support Textmate's `indentNextLinePattern`, this is the best that we can do at the moment.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nFixes

Often these customized versions of Atom are modified versions of the Stable branch of Atom with mismatched versions of built-in components. These updated components are taken from the Beta channel or `master` branch and then injected into the Stable version and a new Atom package is generated. Because of the way Atom is constructed, using these mismatched components can cause mysterious and hard-to-diagnose problems. You can find out more about [why we chose to not support unofficial distributions here](https://github.com/atom/design-decisions/blob/master/unofficial-atom-distributions.md).  If you can still reproduce the problem on an official distribution of Atom, please feel free to create a new issue.","created_at":"2017-05-14T20:13:02Z","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/language-java/issues/92#issuecomment-301336762","id":301336762,"issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/language-java/issues/92","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTMzNjc2Mg==","reactions":{"+1":0,"-1":0,"confused":0,"eyes":0,"heart":0,"hooray":0,"laugh":0,"rocket":0,"total_count":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/language-java/issues/comments/301336762/reactions"},"reactions_data":[],"updated_at":"2017-05-14T20:13:02Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/language-java/issues/comments/301336762","user":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","id":2766036,"login":"50Wliu","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjYwMzY=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu"},"user_data":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","bio":"@atom maintainer and TF2 plugin developer (in particular FF2 and TF2x10).","blog":"","company":null,"created_at":"2012-11-10T13:10:37Z","email":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","followers":214,"followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following":3,"following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","hireable":null,"html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","id":2766036,"location":null,"login":"50Wliu","name":"Winston Liu","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjYwMzY=","organizations":[{"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1089146?v=4","description":"Free and open source text editor, brought to you by GitHub","events_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/events","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/hooks","id":1089146,"issues_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/issues","login":"atom","members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/members{/member}","node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEwODkxNDY=","public_members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/public_members{/member}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/repos","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom"},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3885009?v=4","description":"","events_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/50DKP/events","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/50DKP/hooks","id":3885009,"issues_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/50DKP/issues","login":"50DKP","members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/50DKP/members{/member}","node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM4ODUwMDk=","public_members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/50DKP/public_members{/member}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/50DKP/repos","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/50DKP"},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7704921?v=4","description":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/github-beta/events","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/github-beta/hooks","id":7704921,"issues_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/github-beta/issues","login":"github-beta","members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/github-beta/members{/member}","node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc3MDQ5MjE=","public_members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/github-beta/public_members{/member}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/github-beta/repos","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/github-beta"},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9948688?v=4","description":"This organization is not affiliated with Github, Inc.

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nIntroduces two optimizations to variable matching.\r\n\r\n1. Make the storage type group atomic to prevent useless backtracking.  This sped up tokenization time by about 100% for me (~26ms) when testing on regex101.com (https://regex101.com/r/gXSE7p/1).\r\n2. Instead of throwing a jumble of characters and saying \"hey, if one of these matches, maybe you can form a coherent match out of them?\" make the match coherent to begin with.  This was the main cause of the catastrophic backtracking because of the inclusion of *both* `,` and `\\s` in the character class.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nI debated attempting a rewrite of the `begin` pattern, but I think this will suffice for now.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nWhen given a large single-line enum, Atom should no longer hang.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nIt may be non-apparent when the new regression test fails on CI, because it'll most likely timeout the build itself rather than actually failing.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nFixes

By filing an Issue, you are expected to comply with it, including treating everyone with respect: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\r\n\r\nDo you want to ask a question?

The Atom message board is the best place for getting support: https://discuss.atom.io\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n* [X] Done, none of them, except searching for an already filed bug report. They seemed irrelevant for this issue.\r\n* [ ] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=\u2713&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSyntax highlighting for Java ternary operator is confused when used with the 'new' keyword and strings that have ':' character in them.\r\n```((1==1) ? new Date().toString() + \" : \" : \"\");```\r\nThe above example makes the first '\"' character not start a string. Therefore '?' matches with the first ':' it sees. It also breaks the syntax highlighting for the rest of the file. Although the problem can be easily solved by getting 'new Date()' into paranthesis, this is still a valid Java code and should be highlighted correctly.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Set grammar to Java\r\n2. type this: \r\n```((1==1) ? new Date().toString() + \" : \" : \"\");```\r\n3. Type more lines below to see the effect.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** '?' should only match the first valid ':' character, which is the second one in my case.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** It matches the first one it sees instead.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Always\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nOS: macOS: Sierra\r\n```\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n$ apm --version\r\napm  1.18.1\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.11.0\r\n```\r\n","closed_at":"2017-08-09T01:20:47Z","comments":2,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for reporting this!

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to fix reported #97 issue, when `new` keyword inside the array declaration would not stop after `}` and highlight `;` as part of variable definition (and also invisible characters such as EOL if they are enabled in editor.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nA[] arr = new A[] {new A(), new A()};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like this behaviour is controlled by `;`, `)`, `,`, `:` characters, for example when having `,` after the last item highlights everything correctly:\r\n```\r\nA[] arr = new A[] { new A(), new A(),};\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent solution is simply adding `}` to the list of such characters so we can close constructor correctly. Tested manually and with unit tests (none of existing unit tests failed). Also tested with blocks and when syntax is not properly closed, such as:\r\n```\r\nstatic {\r\n  new A();\r\n  new A() };\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis invalid syntax produces the same html as before this patch.

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\nThis pull request fixes issue with tokenising generics array. Example of code is below:\r\n```java\r\nclass A<T> {\r\n  private B<T>[] arr;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason why it was broken is variable pattern that now considers either generic declaration or primitive array (`[]` to be precise). The solution is combining those pattern into a chain rather than OR.\r\n\r\nBefore this patch:\r\n<img width=\"269\" alt=\"before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7788766/30517262-9e6b0abe-9bad-11e7-8ea1-28a11ed50948.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"266\" alt=\"after\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7788766/30517264-a4b4c2d4-9bad-11e7-833d-749e618b1e29.png\">\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\nOnly one approach was considered - modifying `variables` pattern to handle such highlighting. Note that this is not very common in Java to use generics array like this, but is still worth fixing.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nFixes broken highlight.

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\nIn released version of Atom 1.17.0 and in current master branch there is an issue when expression inside `if (...)` is parsed as generics when capitalized variable is used with `<` and some other combinations, see screen shots below. This is also observed when bitwise operators are used. Result is that such _partial generic_ affects all subsequent highlighting (including other functions declarations, etc) as shown on image below. For most part it is merely minor rather annoying, out of ordinary highlighting of variables, not critical at all.\r\n\r\n- Examples that break highlighting: `if (A < a) { ... }`, `if (A < a && b < a) { ... }`, and `if (A < a || b > a) { ... }`, and `t = M << x`\r\n- Examples that work: `if (a < A) { ... }`, `if (a < b) { ... }`\r\n\r\nI tried fixing most of the cases, currently I make sure that pattern for object types terminates when `;` is found, which is basically replacement of `(?<=>)` with `(?<!;)`. I am still not sure why it works, and would appreciate if someone could explain. From manual tests, it looks like this fixes situations with usage `&&` and `||` in `if-else` statements, which my previous PR reported as not covered.\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n<img width=\"205\" alt=\"before1\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/26150042/d7f2c92e-3b50-11e7-9a26-0f02de5ebd02.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"188\" alt=\"before2\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/26150051/dd434c3c-3b50-11e7-888f-f5ec33d8a142.png\">\r\n\r\n### After\r\n<img width=\"188\" alt=\"after1\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/26150056/e354b822-3b50-11e7-8de8-168bb1853003.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"193\" alt=\"after2\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/26150062/e7e46950-3b50-11e7-89d2-3b042a6c0f48.png\">\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\nSome of the designs were proposed in #75, but this solution looks fairly simple and does not break existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nCurrent solution is simple, alternative would require more code, with potentially refactoring large portion of syntax highlighting.

When writing something like this:\r\n```java\r\n/**/ int a = 1;\r\n```\r\nCode highlights the entire line as comment. This happens because the entire line is treated as a beginning of javadoc comment that starts with `/**`, and since it is allowed to be multiline, it affects following lines. This situation should be highlighted as empty comment, which we already have in spec. \r\n\r\nPatch uses pattern `'begin': '^\\\\s*/\\\\*\\\\*(?!/)'` for javadoc comment, so we exclude the immediately following `/`. This means that `/**/` is treated as empty comment, `/***/` is treated as javadoc. All other situations `/** /`, `/*/` are unclosed comments and invalid.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\nNone were considered, it looks like this fix is reasonably sound.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nFixes current bug with highlighting empty comments.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\nNone that I am aware of.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\nFixes #120","closed_at":"2018-01-05T00:22:53Z","comments":3,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@50Wliu please review.

It was realised that we only need to match ending of literal when it is not escaped, any single quote with preceding '\\\\' should be marked as escaped.\r\n\r\nBefore patch:\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"before-patch\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7788766/35191048-179a1002-fed6-11e7-88b0-3512255668ad.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter patch:\r\n<img width=\"495\" alt=\"after-patch\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7788766/35191049-1ddaa09e-fed6-11e7-8928-668bfd023065.png\">\r\n\r\nAlso correctly highlights situation `'\\\\   '`, though I am not sure if this is a correct syntax. \r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\nNone were considered apart from the PR solution.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nFixes issue of highlighting when escaping single quote in single quote string literal.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\nMight break some other code, because I am not very familiar with expression language and could have overlooked some escape situations, such as using the `\\\\'` as a value.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\nFixes #83\r\n","closed_at":"2018-02-14T04:53:21Z","comments":9,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@50Wliu could you review this pull request?

width=\"401\" alt=\"highlight\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7788766/36142370-c2e090f6-110c-11e8-8c07-5881bd20de4c.png\">\r\n\r\n> Variables/constants starting with a capital letter are scoped as storage.type.java\r\n\r\nYes, this is the problem highlighted in https://github.com/atom/language-java/issues/76.\r\n\r\nThe rest (angle brackets highlighting) should be highlighted correctly. Yes, there are inconsistency with scopes. Normal generic types are highlighted correctly with `punctuation.bracket.angle.java`. Example of `(Node<K, V>) someValue` uses `keyword.operator.comparison.java` for some weird reason - will have a look.\r\n\r\nSo it looks like there are 3 problems: \r\n- Capital letters variables (#76).\r\n- Problems with highlighting generics when class name has dots, e.g. `Set<Map.Entry<K, V>>`.\r\n- Generic angle brackets have the wrong scope in situations like `something = (A<B>) value`.\r\n\r\nWill try addressing the latter and see what we can do about capitalised

I just tried different combinations of patterns to see which one worked.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nFixes the issue, without breaking existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\nThis does not fix code like following, parts `java.util.Set` and `java.lang.String` are highlighted incorrectly:\r\n```java\r\nclass A {\r\n  java.util.Set<java.util.List<K>> varA = null;\r\n  java.lang.String varB = null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut I think this is outside of the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\nFixes #131 \r\n\r\n","closed_at":"2018-03-05T15:03:49Z","comments":2,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@50Wliu Could you please review this PR?

It was broken after I merged varargs -> capitalised variables pull requests.\r\nThe reason it started failing is that for capital variables we check if storage type is followed by variable name. This does not work for `...` varargs, e.g. `String ... args`. So I included it in the regexp. Yes, it is not pretty, but fixes tests and I checked manually with different codes.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\nNone, unfortunately, just wanted to fix it. Other ways would be reconsidering how to work with capital variables.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nFixes master branch.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\nThe fix makes `object-types` scope messy.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\nNone\r\n","closed_at":"2018-03-06T01:32:25Z","comments":2,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@50Wliu I \"patched\" the code to pass tests.

These keywords look specific to a module. For example, I was thinking if it would be better to have `module` scope that resembles `class` scope, since they are very similar, and have all those keywords within the module scope. This approach would not break existing highlighting in the code that uses them as identifiers - the keywords are **only \"keywords\" within a module**, not in other code.\r\n\r\nHere is an example (one of the ways to do it):\r\n\r\nInclude our scope to global `patterns`, since it has its own file, sort of:\r\n```cson\r\n{\r\n  'include': '#module'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we would create an initial draft of module, which is already pretty good. This allows us to extend it later with other rules, e.g. `requires XYZ;` only on one line, etc.\r\n```cson\r\n'module':\r\n  # a uniquely named, reusable group of related packages, as well as resources (such as images\r\n  # and XML files).\r\n  'begin': '((open)\\\\s)?(module)\\\\s+(\\\\w+)'\r\n  'end': '}'\r\n  'beginCaptures':\r\n    '1':\r\n      'name': 'storage.modifier.java'\r\n    '3':\r\n      'name': 'storage.modifier.java'\r\n    '4':\r\n      'name': 'entity.name.type.module.java'\r\n  'endCaptures':\r\n    '0':\r\n      'name': 'punctuation.section.module.end.bracket.curly.java'\r\n  'name': 'meta.module.java'\r\n  'patterns': [\r\n    {\r\n      'begin': '{'\r\n      'beginCaptures':\r\n        '0':\r\n          'name': 'punctuation.section.module.begin.bracket.curly.java'\r\n      'end': '(?=})'\r\n      'contentName': 'meta.module.body.java'\r\n      'patterns': [\r\n        # TODO: Write more rules for module grammar\r\n        {\r\n          'match': '\\\\b(requires|transitive|exports|opens|to|uses|provides|with)\\\\b'\r\n          'name': 'keyword.module.java'\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBelow is the diff for this, you can use it if you want, or you can write your own (it is a fun exercise, IMHO):

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the code for scopes `meta.catch.java` and `meta.throwables.java` and fixes scoping of exception class names and/or parameters.\r\n\r\nFor `meta.catch.java` we are currently include `parameters` scope, which is not exactly correct, because parameters are assumed to be `storage + variable`, but in the case of catch block, you could see something like this `Exception1 | Exception2 err`, so we would only highlight the second case. I replaced it with the pattern that scopes `|` as separator and require `storage` and optional `variable` name.\r\n\r\nFor `meta.throwables.java` we are currently including `object-types` scope, which is also not 100% correct, because they assume `storage` followed by `variable`, but in `throws` you could see something like this `throws Exception1, Exception2`.

So I went with this fairly straightforward approach.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nFixes issue of scoping exceptions in `catch` and `throws`.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\nNone that I found, it does not affect existing scopes.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\nCloses #138\r\n","closed_at":"2018-06-02T07:50:10Z","comments":2,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@50Wliu could you have a look at this PR?

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\nThis PR fixes issue with broken highlighting when resource expression is not closed with `;` in try-with-resources pattern, which is technically allowed. @50Wliu suggested to come up with separate pattern for try-with-resources, which I simplified a bit by keeping original try-catch-finally, but instead creating separate pattern for variable definition. \r\n\r\nSuch pattern is called `variables-definition-only` and used in try-with-resources to match the following: `String variable =` or `int num =` without actual expression. We use `#code` in patterns to highlight the expression code. \r\n\r\nIn this case `meta.definition.variable.java` only covers type, variable name and `=`. I am not sure if this is required to add code, but it highlights correctly.\r\n\r\nAfter patch (also passes test case mentioned in the issue):\r\n<img width=\"294\" alt=\"after-patch\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7788766/35179953-3043e56e-fe0a-11e7-8757-98f06bc0ddf2.png\">\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\nAlternative design was considered where we apply a hack to `end` by listing `)` as another terminating character. This is a very small fix (4-8 characters change), but could potentially result in other issues, such as triggering close on closing paren (see https://github.com/atom/language-java/issues/88#issuecomment-333003571).\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nFixes issue where not using `;` (which is allowed by specification) would break the highlighting. This change is relatively minor and only affects `try-with-resources`.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\nSince we have to duplicate large regular expression to capture variables (in `variables` and `variables-definition-only`), this could potentially result in updating only one but not the other. I added comment that both patterns should be updated and be in sync, but this might be enough.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\nFixes #88\r\n","closed_at":"2018-07-03T06:59:28Z","comments":10,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@50Wliu could you review this PR, please?

Open new file\r\n2. Enter:\r\n```java\r\nclass Main {\r\n    public static void main() {\r\n        try (Foo foo = bar) {\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nThe `meta.try.resources.java` scope ends at the closing parenthesis and the try body gets the scope `meta.try.body.java`.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nThe `meta.try.resources.java` scope does never end and the try body still has the scopes `meta.try.resources.java` and `meta.definition.variable.java`.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nReproduced in:\r\n```\r\n$atom --version \r\nAtom    : 1.16.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n(build from source)\r\n\r\nWith language-java at  `0.27.0` and in `master` (i.e. 7b4c32a4).\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ uname -a\r\nLinux arch-pc 4.10.11-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Tue Apr 18 08:39:42 CEST 2017 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other issues\r\n\r\nSupport for try-with-resources was originally added in #80 after being reported in #79.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThe Java Spec defines the syntax of this language element as:\r\n```\r\nTryWithResourcesStatement:\r\n    try ResourceSpecification Block [Catches] [Finally]\r\nResourceSpecification:\r\n    ( ResourceList [;] )\r\nResourceList:\r\n    Resource {; Resource}\r\nResource:\r\n    {VariableModifier} UnannType VariableDeclaratorId = Expression\r\n```\r\nSee: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.20.3\r\n\r\nTherefore the semicolon after the \"ResourceList\" is optional. Furthermore the resources in the try-with-resources can't be arbitrarily code (link it is currently the case), but have to be a special kind of assignment.\r\n\r\nRelevant source code: [grammars/java.cson L532](https://github.com/atom/language-java/blob/7b4c32a4c97fa2a01eaaa2ae08a085ee08bba8fb/grammars/java.cson#L532)\r\n\r\nI would fix it myself but I have no time at the moment + few experience with atom grammars, but maybe i have some time to look into it in the future.","closed_at":"2018-07-14T06:29:35Z","comments":6,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The best way to implement this is to create a separate rule for try-with-resources,

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `variables` and `member-variables` patterns and changes the behaviour of the `meta.definition.variable.java` scope. This is done to fix #88 (try-with-resources issue) to handle `;`.\r\n\r\nI propose to define `meta.definition.variable.java` to be just declaration part without the following expression to initialise the variable, e.g. `[int a] = 5;` or `[int a];`, where `[...]` is `meta.definition.variable.java`. This results in the right hand side not having the scope, but I could potentially define and assign another one, like `meta.initialization.expression.java` or something similar.\r\n\r\nAfter patch (also passes test case mentioned in the issue):\r\n```java\r\nclass A {\r\n  void func() {\r\n    try (Buffer a = new Buffer()) {\r\n      str = \"str\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    try (\r\n      Buffer a = new Buffer();\r\n      Buffer b = new Buffer();\r\n      Buffer c = new Buffer()\r\n    ) {\r\n      str = \"str\";\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"294\" alt=\"after-patch\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7788766/35179953-3043e56e-fe0a-11e7-8757-98f06bc0ddf2.png\">\r\n\r\nI updated the existing tests to remove `meta.definition.variable.java` wherever it is not needed, and added more tests to check the correct behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\nAlternative design was considered where we apply a hack to `end` by listing `)` as another terminating character. This is a very small fix (4-8 characters change), but could potentially result in other issues, such as triggering close on closing paren (see https://github.com/atom/language-java/issues/88#issuecomment-333003571).\r\n\r\nAnother alternative design was proposed in #124, but it is more intrusive and results in duplicating variables pattern code and increases maintenance cost, since both patterns must be updated in case of any changes.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nFixes issue when not using `;` (which is allowed by specification) would break the highlighting.\r\nPotentially helps to fix other problems related to variable highlighting.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\nWe remove `meta.definition.variable.java` scope from the expression that follows `=`. The left hand side is okay. Arguably, the right hand side should not be scoped as variable definition.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\nFixes #88\r\nRelates to PR #124\r\n","closed_at":"2018-07-14T06:29:35Z","comments":7,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@50Wliu can you have a look at this PR?

This makes the size of the block 0, so nothing is actually happening inside the block, just in the beginCaptures, so I just converted the beginCaptures to their own matching group.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nI tried to figure out if this was originally intended to do something else, but I couldn't get that syntax to do anything useful even in simple cases. \r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nThe code is easier to understand.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThis might have had some other purpose I'm not seeing, but if so it wasn't working.

the variable rule only consists of lookahead, this causes a loop with the rule to be entered and exited again.\r\n\r\nVSCode prints a warning when that happens, Atom silently ignores.\r\nHowever, both

To be clear, all my input has been with regards to the original issue (`Grammar is in an endless loop - Grammar pushed the same rule without advancing error in editor`). \r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, this grammar enters a loop when you follow the reproduction steps in the original post. My input has been to show why and where this is happening.\r\n\r\nThere are also two perspectives on this:\r\n\r\n> As far as I can tell based on your images, error case is handled, not\r\nignored\r\n\r\n- @sadikovi thinks this is an issue with the TextMate (VS Code) engine, and not the grammar. Atom popping the rule when it repeats itself is _handling_ it, not _ignoring_ it.\r\n\r\n> the endless loop is always caused by catastrophic backtracking in a specific regular expression and not by engine differences\r\n\r\n> Atom doesn't warn on that, but it's not a good thing to have.\r\n\r\n- @alexandrudima & @aeschli think this is an issue with the grammar, and not the TextMate (VS Code) engine.

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [ ] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't

https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdd unit test for the PR #152, seems like we merged it too soon, I will add a test based on the snippet:\r\n```\r\nclass A {\r\n  aint s = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also found that when inlined, the next statement does not highlight the number 9 properly:\r\n```\r\nclass A {\r\n  int foo = 9; int foo() { return 0; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this works correctly:\r\n```\r\nclass A {\r\n  int foo = 9; \r\n  \r\n  int foo() { \r\n    return 0; \r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes enum scope and highlighting to make sure that we can handle different variations of enums, e.g. \r\n```java\r\nenum Test {\r\n  A, B, C\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprotected enum Test {\r\n  A(123),\r\n  B(234);\r\n\r\n  void func() {\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass A {\r\n  private enum Test {\r\n    A,\r\n    B,\r\n    C\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe proposed design extends the existing `enum` scope and adds handling of storage modifiers (`private`, `protected`, etc.) and fixes issues when enum constants were not highlighted correctly in nested enums. I also extended the existing tests and added new ones to cover added functionality.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nNone apart from the one mentioned in description above.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nFixes scope and highlighting for various enums, that were not supported previously.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nNot many, since it only affects enums.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nCloses #154 \r\n","closed_at":"2018-09-06T21:15:52Z","comments":1,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@50Wliu I updated the code.

By filing an Issue, you are expected to comply with it, including treating everyone with respect: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\r\n\r\nDo you want to ask a question? Are you looking for support? The Atom message board is the best place for getting support: https://discuss.atom.io\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=\u2713&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHere's a couple screenshots, which should explain everything. The first is within a Markdown document, and the second is the same snippet, in its own file.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-09-12 at 10 39 48 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4483844/45464067-d9ec4300-b6dc-11e8-9792-3de11fd73cd2.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-09-12 at 10 41 25 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4483844/45464104-06a05a80-b6dd-11e8-85ed-8a12045cc4a2.png)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Type the above into a source file.\r\n\r\nHere's the source code, if you just want to copy/paste:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Java 6\r\nstatic String readFirstLineFromFile(String path) throws IOException {\r\n    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path));\r\n    try {\r\n        return br.readLine();\r\n    } finally {\r\n        if (br != null) br.close();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Java 7\r\nstatic String readFirstLineFromFile(String path) throws IOException {\r\n    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) {\r\n        return br.readLine();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're curious, it's mostly stolen from [this tutorial example targeting Java 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html), just with the methods renamed.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** It to highlight correctly.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Lots of incorrect red highlighting.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% of the time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.\r\n\r\nAtom version: 1.30.0\r\napm version: 1.19.0\r\nOS: macOS High Sierra (64-bit)\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nAny additional information, configuration or data that might be necessary to reproduce the issue.\r\n","closed_at":"2018-09-13T05:03:12Z","comments":1,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This was fixed in #146 but hasn't made its way into an Atom release

So let's keep it as a fallback plan, in case there is no general enough solution.\r\n\r\nWe had a discussion some time ago, and one of the approaches was solving from the perspective of `<`, `>`, or `<<`, `>>` operators in parenthesis. We know that one cannot use `< >`, it must be separated by `&&` or `||`, etc. We also know that generics should not match in this example `a << b >> c`.\r\n\r\nMy initial pull request was around fixing those angle brackets in parenthesis that had been originally parsed as generics, which could have been causing this issue as well (https://github.com/atom/language-java/pull/93)\r\n\r\nIt could be useful to create such patterns of matching `<` and `>` operators in parenthesis and then falling back to generics, etc., sort of going the other way of trying to eliminate an option of angle brackets before generics. I have not tried that, may give it a go this weekend. You are very welcome to also try it and see if it makes sense at all. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-26T06:26:46Z","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/language-java/pull/148#issuecomment-407990514","id":407990514,"issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/language-java/issues/148","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNzk5MDUxNA==","reactions":{"+1":0,"-1":0,"confused":0,"eyes":0,"heart":0,"hooray":0,"laugh":0,"rocket":0,"total_count":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/language-java/issues/comments/407990514/reactions"},"reactions_data":[],"updated_at":"2018-07-26T06:27:45Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/language-java/issues/comments/407990514","user":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","id":7788766,"login":"sadikovi","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi"},"user_data":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","bio":null,"blog":"","company":"@databricks","created_at":"2014-06-04T03:54:22Z","email":"ivan.sadikov@gmail.com","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","followers":28,"followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following":41,"following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","hireable":true,"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","id":7788766,"location":"New Zealand","login":"sadikovi","name":"Ivan","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","organizations":[{"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1089146?v=4","description":"Free and open source text editor, brought to you by GitHub","events_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/events","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/hooks","id":1089146,"issues_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/issues","login":"atom","members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/members{/member}","node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEwODkxNDY=","public_members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/public_members{/member}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/repos","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom"},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4998052?v=4","description":"","events_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/databricks/events","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/databricks/hooks","id":4998052,"issues_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/databricks/issues","login":"databricks","members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/databricks/members{/member}","node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ5OTgwNTI=","public_members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/databricks/public_members{/member}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/databricks/repos","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/databricks"},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/20922857?v=4","description":"","events_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lightcopy/events","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lightcopy/hooks","id":20922857,"issues_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lightcopy/issues","login":"lightcopy","members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lightcopy/members{/member}","node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIwOTIyODU3","public_members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lightcopy/public_members{/member}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lightcopy/repos","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lightcopy"}],"organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","public_gists":86,"public_repos":80,"received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","type":"User","updated_at":"2019-03-22T22:59:53Z","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi"}},{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@brennenberkley any progress on this issue?

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for `var` storage type that is used in Java 10 to indicate local variable with inferred type. Details can be found here: http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286.\r\n\r\nI created a new pattern `variables-local` specifically for declarations `var x = ...`. This allows to only highlight `var` keyword when it is actually a storage type. I tested on the following code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Test {\r\n  void func() {\r\n    A a = new A();\r\n    var b = new B();\r\n    // should be scoped as a variable name\r\n    C var = new C();\r\n    // should be scoped as a variable name\r\n    var = new C();\r\n    {var d = new D();}\r\n\r\n    for (var d : elements()) {\r\n      // should highlight as storage type\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"340\" alt=\"before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7788766/45925898-d26b3c00-bf1d-11e8-905e-02beaf207e47.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"330\" alt=\"after\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7788766/45925899-d6975980-bf1d-11e8-9431-4c607642027b.png\">\r\n\r\nI added `#variables-local` to `#code` just next to `#variables` pattern. This has it's benefits, such as working out of the box inside for loops and code blocks. Unfortunately, this highlights `var x = ...` when defined in class body, which will result in compilation error based on the JDK doc, but I guess it should be okay.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nNone were considered apart from adding `variables-local` pattern separately to scopes where it should be defined, but I think this would have been messy and would have still had issues.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nAdds a feature of `var` support.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nShould not impact any existing code, even if they use `var` as a variable name.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nCloses #162\r\n","closed_at":"2018-10-23T21:52:47Z","comments":2,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@50Wliu would you mind reviewing this PR?

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the regression reported in #158. This happened because our variable definition now ends with `=`, and the rest is supposed to be matched by the code, which does happen correctly, but it breaks in certain scenarios when using class fields, e.g.\r\n```java\r\nclass A {\r\n  private String b = a + \"a()\" + a() + \"\" + \"a();\" + \"\" + a() + abc + b() + \"b();\";\r\n  private String c = \"a / a();\";\r\n  private int d[] = a + \"a();\" + func();\r\n\r\n  int abcd() {\r\n    return 1;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n<img width=\"691\" alt=\"before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7788766/45589511-114e3000-b927-11e8-98c9-94b52dc37f8f.png\">\r\n\r\n### After\r\n<img width=\"691\" alt=\"after\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7788766/45589512-13b08a00-b927-11e8-8083-3eb0fd051069.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of the `b`, `c`, and `d` would break a subsequent highlighting and scope of method `abcd`.\r\n\r\nThe fix is fairly straightforward and might seem as a hack. We define `#class-fields-and-methods` scope instead of `#methods` and first match anything like this `... = [...];`, where `[...]` is covered by `#code`, and only then we match methods. This seems to work quite well.\r\n\r\nI also fixed comments in methods, while I was there. Added tests for both methods and class fields.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nI considered reverting #146 at some point, but then we would still have to solve `;` issue in try with resources, and, to be fair, the change in that PR was more or less reasonable.\r\n\r\nI also tried updating pattern for `#methods` scope trying to restrict it, so that it does not show up in the expression part. It turned out to be quite difficult, mostly because of the return type and parameter types being potentially anything, which complicated the task. For example, I tried writing something like this: \r\n```cson\r\n'methods':\r\n    'begin': '(?!new)(?=[\\\\w<].*\\\\s+)(?=[\\\\w\\\\s\\\\[\\\\]<>,\\\\.\\\\?/\\\\*]+\\\\()'\r\n```\r\nBut it did not work in certain cases.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nFixes the regression introduced by #146.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nCould potentially miss coverage of some other case.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nCloses #158\r\n","closed_at":"2018-10-23T22:03:10Z","comments":2,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@50Wliu could you review this PR?

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis PR extends support for enums and adds a pattern to handle enum's constant fields with method overrides. It is allowed to have such fields mixed with the previous two types that we have added.\r\n\r\nThe fix is fairly simple - adding another pattern to handle the case of enum field starting with `{` and ending with `}` similar to inner class. For that reason, I used `include: #class-body` instead of `include: #code`.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nNone were considered, since it is fairly simple fix.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nFixes enum highlighting for enums with override methods.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nNone. It only affects changes for enums.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nCloses #173 \r\n","closed_at":"2018-12-04T08:06:49Z","comments":2,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ping @50Wliu ","created_at":"2018-12-02T18:13:58Z","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/language-java/pull/175#issuecomment-443529439","id":443529439,"issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/language-java/issues/175","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzUyOTQzOQ==","reactions":{"+1":0,"-1":0,"confused":0,"eyes":0,"heart":0,"hooray":0,"laugh":0,"rocket":0,"total_count":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/language-java/issues/comments/443529439/reactions"},"reactions_data":[],"updated_at":"2018-12-02T18:13:58Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/language-java/issues/comments/443529439","user":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","id":7788766,"login":"sadikovi","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi"},"user_data":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","bio":null,"blog":"","company":"@databricks","created_at":"2014-06-04T03:54:22Z","email":"ivan.sadikov@gmail.com","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","followers":28,"followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following":41,"following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","hireable":true,"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","id":7788766,"location":"New Zealand","login":"sadikovi","name":"Ivan","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","organizations":[{"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1089146?v=4","description":"Free and open source text editor, brought to you by GitHub","events_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/events","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/hooks","id":1089146,"issues_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/issues","login":"atom","members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/members{/member}","node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEwODkxNDY=","public_members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/public_members{/member}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom/repos","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/atom"},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4998052?v=4","description":"","events_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/databricks/events","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/databricks/hooks","id":4998052,"issues_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/databricks/issues","login":"databricks","members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/databricks/members{/member}","node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ5OTgwNTI=","public_members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/databricks/public_members{/member}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/databricks/repos","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/databricks"},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/20922857?v=4","description":"","events_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lightcopy/events","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lightcopy/hooks","id":20922857,"issues_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lightcopy/issues","login":"lightcopy","members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lightcopy/members{/member}","node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIwOTIyODU3","public_members_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lightcopy/public_members{/member}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lightcopy/repos","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lightcopy"}],"organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","public_gists":86,"public_repos":80,"received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","type":"User","updated_at":"2019-03-22T22:59:53Z","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi"}},{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think I am going to merge this PR.
