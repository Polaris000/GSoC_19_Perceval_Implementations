      "line is: [9:00:19 PM IST] <Polaris000>\tI mean, the cleaning takes place inside a class and the analysis occurs outside it\n",

      "\n",
      "line is: [9:01:43 PM IST] <jgbarah>\tfor testatility, and reuse, it makes sense to have classes and all that, and then notebooks\n",
      "\n",
      "line is: [9:02:13 PM IST] <jgbarah>\tthe main idea of notebooks is to explain the implementation, and to have it in a way easy to consult and run at the same time\n",
      "\n",
      "line is: [9:02:36 PM IST] <jgbarah>\tBut scripts can serve also for all that, and are more easily runnable...\n",
      "\n",
      "line is: [9:02:44 PM IST] <jgbarah>\tSo, my heart is split... ;-)\n",
      "\n",
      "line is: [9:03:01 PM IST] <Polaris000>\tAccording to that, it would make sense to have the analysis outside, with the main cleaning done inside classes :)\n",
      "\n",
      "line is: [9:03:09 PM IST] <Polaris000>\tSame here, @jgbarah :)\n",
      "\n",
      "line is: [9:03:50 PM IST] <jgbarah>\tLet's work with some of the implementations, and let's find out choices and effects...\n",
      "\n",
      "line is: [9:04:12 PM IST] <Polaris000>\tGood idea @jgbarah!\n",
      "\n",
      "line is: [9:04:30 PM IST] <valcos>\t@Polaris000 as an example can we refer to the notebook in microtask6: https://github.com/Polaris000/Chaoss_19_Microtasks/blob/master/microtask6/microtask6.ipynb ?\n",

      "\n",
      "line is: [9:05:27 PM IST] <Polaris000>\tthe first is collecting the data (not in classes and using bash commands)\n",
      "\n",
      "line is: [9:05:39 PM IST] <Polaris000>\tthe second is cleaning and inside the class\n",
      "\n",
      "line is: [9:05:49 PM IST] <Polaris000>\tThe analysis is for the most part, outside classes\n",
      "\n",
      "line is: [9:06:02 PM IST] <valcos>\tperfect! this notebook looks really clear\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "line is: [9:06:40 PM IST] <jgbarah>\tFor the scripts to be easily runnable, likely we will start with a JSON file produced by Perceval\n",
      "\n",
      "line is: [9:06:52 PM IST] <jgbarah>\tthat also make them more reproducible.\n",
      "\n",
      "line is: [9:07:01 PM IST] <jgbarah>\tBut we can consider other options...\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "line is: [9:08:03 PM IST] <jgbarah>\tand then this is produced either by reading a JSON file, or live from a repo\n",
      "\n",
